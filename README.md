# Brute-Force-ZIP-Password-Cracker
This Python script attempts to extract a password-protected ZIP file using a wordlist (e.g., rockyou.txt) by performing a brute-force attack. It iterates through each password in the wordlist and tries to extract the ZIP file using that password. If successful, the script reveals the correct password.
